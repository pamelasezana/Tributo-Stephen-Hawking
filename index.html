                    Stephen William Hawking, known as Stephen Hawking, was born in Oxford, England, on January 8, 1942.<br>His father studied medicine and his mother studied philosophy, politics and economics, both at Oxford University.<br> At the age of six, he was already building toy trains. Considered a precocious child, his schoolmates nicknamed him Einstein.
                    <p>
                        Stephen hated math because he found it too easy. <br>His passion was physics and astronomy. At the age of 17 he won a scholarship to study physics at Oxford University.<br>His colleagues were two years older than him. Having completed his Physics course, Stephen was accepted into the Masters at Cambridge University.

                    <p>
                        At the age of 21, after a fall from skates, Stephen was taken to the doctor, who diagnosed him with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),<br> a degenerative disease that would progressively paralyze his muscles, and according to the doctor, would lead him to death in a maximum of three years. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the devastating diagnosis, in 1965, Stephen marries Jane Wilde, a friend of one of his sisters.<br> At the wedding party he was already leaning on a cane.
        
        In 1970, Stephen stopped walking and started using a wheelchair.<br>At that time, he already had three children and was a well-known physicist who worked at the California Institute of Technology in the United States.
